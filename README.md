## Releases

This project uses
[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to
automate package publishing when making changes to the `main` or `alpha` branch.

It is recommended to branch off the `alpha` branch and follow
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
when making changes. When your changes are ready for pull request, this should
be opened against the `alpha` branch.

[Read more in-depth about Fabric Releases here](https://github.com/fabric-ds/issues/blob/779d59723993c13d62374516259602d967da56ca/rfcs/0004-releases.md).

Please note that the version published will depend on your commit message
structure. We use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to help
follow this structure:

```
npm install -g commitizen
```

When installed, you should be able to type `cz` or `git cz` in your terminal to
commit your changes (replacing `git commit`).
